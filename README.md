# Second-Hand Car Selling Price Prediction

## Introduction

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict the selling price of second-hand cars based on various features. With the rise of the used car market, understanding the factors influencing car prices has become crucial for both buyers and sellers. By leveraging data-driven insights, this project aims to provide a reliable method for price prediction.

## Objectives

1. **Analyze the Dataset:** Explore and understand the relationships between features and their impact on car selling prices.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Clean, preprocess, and engineer features to enhance model performance.
3. **Model Development:** Build and evaluate machine learning models to predict selling prices accurately.
4. **Insights Extraction:** Provide actionable insights for buyers, sellers, and industry professionals.

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes the following columns:

- **Name:** The name and model of the car.
- **Year:** The manufacturing year of the car.
- **Selling_Price:** The selling price of the car (target variable).
- **Km_Driven:** The total kilometers driven by the car.
- **Fuel:** Type of fuel used (e.g., Petrol, Diesel, CNG, Electric).
- **Seller_Type:** Whether the seller is an individual or a dealer.
- **Transmission:** Type of transmission (Manual/Automatic).
- **Owner:** Ownership type (e.g., First Owner, Second Owner).
- **Mileage:** Fuel efficiency of the car (e.g., km/l or km/kg).
- **Engine:** Engine capacity in CC.
- **Max_Power:** Maximum power output of the engine.
- **Torque:** The car's torque details.
- **Seats:** Number of seats available in the car.

## Project Goals

1. **Predict Car Selling Prices:** Develop a robust machine learning model that can accurately estimate the selling price based on the input features.
2. **Identify Key Factors:** Highlight the most influential factors affecting car prices.
3. **Enhance Decision-Making:** Provide insights to help buyers make informed decisions and sellers price their cars competitively.

## Insights from the Dataset

- **Age vs. Price:** Older cars tend to have lower resale values.
- **Fuel Type Impact:** Fuel types such as diesel and CNG often influence price differently compared to petrol.
- **Transmission Preferences:** Automatic cars may have higher resale values in urban markets.
- **Kilometers Driven:** Cars with lower mileage generally fetch higher prices.
- **Brand and Model Influence:** Popular brands and models tend to retain value better.

## Steps Undertaken

1. **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values and inconsistencies in the dataset.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualized data trends and relationships between features.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Transformed categorical variables and scaled numerical features.
4. **Evaluation:** Assessed the model's performance using metrics such as R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
5. **Deployment:** Prepared the model for real-world use cases.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning Algorithm:** Linear Regression
- **Platform:** Jupyter Notebook/Google Colab

## Conclusion

This project successfully predicts second-hand car prices with a focus on practical applications in the used car market. It provides a scalable solution for price estimation and enhances transparency in transactions. Further improvements can include integrating more features,Additional features to consider:

- **Color:** Common colors like white, silver, and black are often easier to resell and hold better value, while unusual colors may have lower demand.
- **Warranty:** Cars still under manufacturer or extended warranty can fetch higher prices, as buyers perceive them as less risky.
- **Tyre Condition:** New or well-maintained tyres can positively influence the price, as replacing tyres is an additional expense for buyers.
- **Previous Use:**
  - **Personal Use:** Typically priced higher if the car was privately owned and well cared for.
  - **Commercial Use:** Cars used for taxis, rentals, or fleet services generally have lower resale value due to heavier usage.
- **Insurance Claims History:** A clean insurance record indicates fewer accidents and better care, which increases resale value.
- **Location:** Prices can vary by region due to availability, taxes, and demand.
